S&P 100 P/E Ratio Analysis Case Study

Overview:

This case study involves the analysis of Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios of companies in the S&P 100 index, specifically within the Information Technology (IT) sector. The primary goal is to identify companies with abnormally high P/E ratios, which may suggest overvaluation or high investor expectations.

Project Objectives:

Data Filtering: Identify companies within the S&P 100 IT sector that have P/E ratios greater than a specified threshold (e.g., 20 or 50).
Outlier Detection: Highlight companies with exceptionally high P/E ratios.
Result Interpretation: Display the names of these companies in a user-friendly format.

Data:

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:

- Name: The name of the company.
- Sector: The sector to which the company belongs (e.g., IT, Healthcare, etc.).
- P/E Ratio: The price-to-earnings ratio for the company.
